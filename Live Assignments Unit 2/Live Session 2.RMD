## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Use the PlayerBBall.csv dataset to visually represent (summarize) the number of players in each position. 
```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

#load file in to R
PBBall= read.csv('/Users/adeel/Desktop/Data Science/Doing Data Science/MSDS_6306_Doing-Data-Science Github/Unit 2/PlayersBBall.csv')

#summary statistics
summary(PBBall)

head(PBBall)

#summary players per positions
PBBall %>% ggplot(aes(x=position))+geom_bar()+ggtitle("Distribution Baseball of Postions")

```
Use the dataset to visually investigate the distribution of the weight of centers (C) is greater than the distribution of the weight of forwards (F).  
```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#load file in to R
Ball1= read.csv('/Users/adeel/Desktop/Data Science/Doing Data Science/MSDS_6306_Doing-Data-Science Github/Unit 2/PlayersBBall.csv')

#summary statistics
summary(Ball1)

head(Ball1)

#distribution of weights of centers(C) vs forwards (F)
Ball1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = position ,color = position)) + geom_point()+ggtitle("Distribution of weights of Centers(C) vs Forwards(F)")

#filter data F&C
position_filter = c("F","C")
Ball3 = filter(Ball1, position %in% position_filter)
head(Ball3)

#filter data F
position_filter = c("F")
Ball4 = filter(Ball1, position %in% position_filter)
head(Ball4)

#filter data C
position_filter = c("C")
Ball5 = filter(Ball1, position %in% position_filter)
head(Ball5)


Ball3 %>% ggplot(aes(x = position)) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Distribution of Class")

#distribution of weights of centers(C) vs forwards (F)
Ball3 %>% ggplot(aes(x = weight, fill = position)) + geom_histogram(color = "black")+ggtitle("Distribution of weight of Centers(C) vs Forwards(F)") 

#distribution of weight of centers(C)
Ball5 %>% ggplot(aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(fill = "Red", color = "black")+ggtitle("Distribution of weight of Centers(C)")

#distribution of weight of centers(F)
Ball4 %>% ggplot(aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(fill = "Green", color = "black")+ggtitle("Distribution of weight of Forward(F)")

```

Use the dataset to visually investigate if the distribution of the height of centers (C) is greater than the distribution of the height of forwards (F).

```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#load file in to R
Ball1= read.csv('/Users/adeel/Desktop/Data Science/Doing Data Science/MSDS_6306_Doing-Data-Science Github/Unit 2/PlayersBBall.csv')

#summary statistics
summary(Ball1)

head(Ball1)

#distribution of weights of centers(C) vs forwards (F)
Ball1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = position ,color = position)) + geom_point()+ggtitle("Distribution of weights of Centers(C) vs Forwards(F)")

#filter data F&C
position_filter = c("F","C")
Ball3 = filter(Ball1, position %in% position_filter)
head(Ball3)

#filter data F
position_filter = c("F")
Ball4 = filter(Ball1, position %in% position_filter)
head(Ball4)

#filter data C
position_filter = c("C")
Ball5 = filter(Ball1, position %in% position_filter)
head(Ball5)

#distribution of Height of centers(C) vs forwards (F)
Ball3 %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x = height, fill=position)) + geom_bar()+ggtitle("Distribution of Height of Centers(C) vs Forwards(F)") 

#distribution of weights of centers(C) vs forwards (F)
Ball3 %>% ggplot(aes(x = height, fill = position)) + geom_histogram(color = "black")+ggtitle("Distribution of weight of Centers(C) vs Forwards(F)")

Ball3 %>% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = position,fill = position)) + geom_boxplot(color = "blue")

```

Use the dataset to visually investigate if the distribution of height is different between any of the positions.  

```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#load file in to R
Ball1= read.csv('/Users/adeel/Desktop/Data Science/Doing Data Science/MSDS_6306_Doing-Data-Science Github/Unit 2/PlayersBBall.csv')

#summary statistics
summary(Ball1)

head(Ball1)

Ball1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = position,y = height,color = position)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Distribution of Heights of Baseball Players")

```
Use the dataset to investigate how the player’s height is related to the player’s weight. How does height change as the weight changes?  

```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#load file in to R
Ball1= read.csv('/Users/adeel/Desktop/Data Science/Doing Data Science/MSDS_6306_Doing-Data-Science Github/Unit 2/PlayersBBall.csv')

#summary statistics
summary(Ball1)
head(Ball1)


Ball1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = weight, color = "blue"))+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = height, color = position)) +  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=weight, y= height, linetype = position)) + ggtitle("Height & Weight Correlation")

```

A historian would like to investigate the claim that the heights of players have increased over the years.  Analyze this claim graphically / visually. 
```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#load file in to R
Ball1= read.csv('/Users/adeel/Desktop/Data Science/Doing Data Science/MSDS_6306_Doing-Data-Science Github/Unit 2/PlayersBBall.csv')

#summary statistics
summary(Ball1)
head(Ball1)

Ball1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = year_start,y = height , xlab = "yea")) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Height changes over the years ")

```



Create a 3D plot of height vs. weight vs. year and color code the points by position.
```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

#load file in to R
Ball1= read.csv('/Users/adeel/Desktop/Data Science/Doing Data Science/MSDS_6306_Doing-Data-Science Github/Unit 2/PlayersBBall.csv')

#summary statistics
summary(Ball1)
head(Ball1)

p <- plot_ly(Ball1, x = ~height, y = ~weight, z = ~year_start, color = ~position) %>%
   add_markers() %>%
   layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = 'Player Height'),
                      yaxis = list(title = 'Player Weight'),
                      zaxis = list(title = 'Year')))

Visually test the claim that the distribution of incomes increase (mean or median) as the education level rises.
